The project aims both to serve, and to collaborate with, the scholarly community. Texts are annotated with various levels of linguistic information, such as text-critical, grammatical, semantic and discourse features.\nBeginning with the New Testament, the project aims to construct a representative corpus of Hellenistic Greek to facilitate linguistic and literary research of these important documents. These texts are then annotated through the addition of linguistic and literary features (including marking morphological, syntactical and discourse elements) following a comprehensive model currently under development. The resulting texts can be viewed and searched on this site. It is hoped that interested users will collaborate in the correction and enhancement of this annotation, and become involved in the annotation process themselves.\nThe key features of the project are:\n\ntexts annotated at distinct linguistic levels\nthe use of an XML encoding scheme to mark-up texts\nan ‘open’ and collaborative approach to encourage the annotation and use of texts\nan on-line tool kit to allow searching and analysis of texts",

    "title": "OpenText.org Annotation Model",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction to the Annotation Model\n(Nov. 2004)\nThe clause is recognized as the primary building block in the OpenText.org annotation model because it is the level at which propositions are made. The different types of annotations are thus built around the clause annotation, the word group annotation (which make up the clause components), and the relationship between clauses (including the distinction into distinct primary, secondary, and secondary embedded clause levels) as the base. Table 2 summarizes the major categories of tags for the clause and word group level annotations. The vertical axis of the table delineates the four basic clause level function slots. The horizontal axis of the table gives the three clauses levels. The information within the table refers to the word groups, which fit inside the clause function slots.\n\nTable 2. Clause and Word Group Annotations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClause Level\nSubject (S)\nPredicator (P)\nComplement (C)\nAdjunct (A)\n\n\n\n\nPrimary\nHead Term-Modifiers\nVerbal Form\nHead Term-Modifiers\nHead Term-Modifiers\n\n\nSecondary Unembedded\nHead Term-Modifiers\nVerbal Form\nHead Term-Modifiers\nHead Term-Modifiers\n\n\nSecondary Embedded\nHead Term-Modifiers\nVerbal Form\nHead Term-Modifiers\nHead Term-Modifiers\n\n\n\n\n\nClause Level Annotation\nAt the clause level, only four tags are used, excluding conjunctions between clauses (marked “conj”). To aid understanding, it is helpful to consider the clause functions in terms of function slots. All word groups fit into these function slots. There are only four function slots and they are:\n\nSubject (S)\nPredicator (P)\nComplement (C)\nAdjunct (A)\n\nThe tag subject (S) is used of a word group or the word groups of which something is predicated. (In traditional grammar the distinguishing term is “grammatical subject.”)\nAll verbal forms are tagged as predicators (P).\nA complement (C) is a word group or the word groups that “complete” its predicator. Common complements are direct and indirect objects.\nAn adjunct (A) is a word group or the word groups that modify the predicator, providing an indication of the circumstances associated with the process. Common adjuncts are prepositional and adverbial phrases.\nThis annotation scheme reflects Halliday’s conception of the grammar of a clause (i.e., the transitivity system at the level of a clause). The subjects and complements in the clause level annotation correspond to the participants in a process; the predicators correspond to the processes; and the adjuncts typically correspond to the circumstances associated with the process, though some adjuncts are peripheral participants in a process.\n\n\nWord Group Level Annotation Model\nAt the word group level, all words are basically either head terms or modifiers. The head term usually refers to the nominal that all the other words in the word group modify. Four types of modifiers are identified:\n\nspecifiers (sp)\ndefiners (df)\nqualifiers (ql)\nrelators (rl)\n\nA specifier (sp) is a modifier that classifies or identifies the word it modifies. Common examples of specifiers are articles and prepositions.\nA definer (df) is a modifier that attributes features or further defines the word it modifies. Common examples of definers are adjectives (both attributive and predicate structure) and appositional words or phrases.\nA qualifier (ql) is a modifier that in some way limits or constrains the scope of the word it modifies. Common examples of qualifiers are words in the genitive and dative case.\nA relator (rl) is a word specified by a preposition (i.e., the object of a preposition) that modifies another element within the word group.\n\n\nClause Levels\nClauses are divided into two levels: 1. Primary clauses 2. Secondary clauses\nThe primary and secondary distinction has to do with the two possible types of logical dependency, dependence (hypotaxis) or equality (parataxis).\nPrimary clauses are connected to each other, while secondary clauses are connected to the primary clause to which it is dependent. The majority of primary clauses consist of clauses with a finite verb.\nSecondary clauses are typically distinguished by means of a subordinating conjunction. A second type of secondary clause, the embedded clause, involves the phenomenon of rank-shifting—a linguistic element is embedded to a level of grammar lower than the typical level at which it functions. The majority of secondary embedded clauses in Greek are participial and infinitival clauses.",

    "title": "Can the Text of the Greek New Testament Really be Copyrighted?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The editions of the New Testament commonly in use, such as the Nestle-Aland and UBSGNT texts, are copyrighted by various organizations. There probably is little basis for doubting that some if not much of the work that has gone into the production of these texts should be protected through copyright, especially the punctuation provided and the way in which the text-critical apparatuses that are such an important part of these texts are displayed (verse divisions, of course, pre-date copyright restrictions, since they are medieval). There are also other matters of display, such as alternation of font styles and sizes that are unique to these editions and probably merit protection as well. However, can the texts themselves be copyrighted?\nThe rough claim has been made, even by some of those connected with or the keenest advocates of the standard critical texts in use, that these texts are so close to the original text of the New Testament so as to be virtually the same as that text. If such a claim is valid (and there are many who would dispute it, however), then it would seem to indicate that the text itself of the Greek New Testament cannot and should not be copyrighted, since the text that is being presented is an ancient one, in fact one almost two thousand years old, and hence well beyond any recognizable limit on copyright.\nOthers would perhaps make the claim that the effort involved in transcribing the manuscripts merits copyright protection. That may or may not be true for a particular edition. However, those who have created the standard critical texts are not the editors of the vast majority of the texts that have been used in the compilation of their text. In fact, these standard critical texts, so far as is determinable, are dependent upon much work by earlier scholars who have transcribed these manuscripts. (The issue of whether any library or museum should control access to manuscripts, such that others are not allowed access to them for scholarly and editorial purposes is beyond the limits of comment here.)\nOthers might well pull back from the first claim above regarding the earliness of the text represented by the standard critical editions, claiming as a basis for copyright that the text is one that has been created and updated by contemporary scholars, and therefore merits protection. However, if this is true, then one must wonder what status such a text has in text-critical discussion, since a twentieth-century eclectic text that makes no claim to being early would seem to be an inferior text to a good number of earlier ones, including the major fourth century codexes. Furthermore, examination of the standard critical texts in comparison with some of the earlier manuscripts reveals very little variation at certain points. For example, let’s say that such a standard critical text of today varied in two spellings and four different word forms or phrases from Codex Sinaiticus for a book such as Philemon with 335 words. That would constitute a variance of no more than two percent. Should a difference of two percent constitute a basis for copyright? It would appear that there may be grounds for saying that New Testament Greek texts that purport to represent the earliest text, or that only vary from earlier manuscripts in relatively insignificant ways, do not merit or justify copyright protection, at least as it is usually defined."

    "title": "Transivity",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The concept of transitivity in Halliday’s grammatical system is a powerful tool in the analysis of the meanings expressed in clauses. The term transitivity has a broader and narrower meaning. The narrower meaning (found in traditional grammatical description and the one with which most readers are probably familiar) involves the verb’s relationship to dependent elements of structure. Transitive verbs take a direct object and intransitive verbs do not. Stated differently, the action of the verb extends to another entity in a transitive clause, but not in an intransitive clause. For example, the difference between “The tiger (Actor) pounced (Process)” and “The tiger (Actor) ate (Process) the deer (Goal)” is that the action “eat” extends to “the deer.” In the broader meaning (as proposed by Halliday and assumed in the OpenText.org annotation), the system of transitivity consists of the various types of processes together with the structures that realize these processes.\nThere are three basic elements to all process structures—the process itself, the participants in the process, and the circumstances associated with the process. Halliday distinguishes six process types. The three main process types are:\n\nmaterial (i.e., what is going on outside oneself)\nmental (i.e, inner experience—awareness of our own states of being and reaction to our outer experience)\nrelational (i.e., classifying and identifying one experience with other experiences). Stated differently, material processes basically involve a participant (the Actor/Agent) doing something to another participant (the Goal/Object). Mental processes involve the human senses—perception, affection, and cognition. Relational processes relate two terms in a variety of ways (similar to how the verb “to be” is used in English). The other three process types are located at the boundaries between the main process types. Behavioral processes border the material and mental, being outward expressions of inner workings. Verbal processes straddle the mental and relational: symbolic relationships are recognized and constructed in human consciousness. Existential processes border the relational and the material: phenomena are recognized to exist or to happen.\n\nIn the OpenText.org clause level annotation:\n\nthe subjects (S) and complements (C) correspond to the participants in a process\nthe predicators (P) correspond to the processes\nand the adjuncts (A) typically correspond to the circumstances associated with the process, though some adjuncts are peripheral participants in a process\n\nThe following are examples of the six process types found in 1 Thessalonians chapters 3 and 4:\nIn 1 Thess. 4.14 (clause 1Thes.c4_53 in the annotation), the verb ἄξει, “he will lead,” gives a material process. God will do something to those who died through Christ, specifically he will bring along with Christ those who have died through Christ.\n\nIn 1 4.2 (clause 1Thes.c4_9), the verb οἴδατε, “we know,”portrays a mental process of cognition. (What is known is expressed by the c4_10: “what commands we gave you through the Lord Jesus.”)\n\nIn 4.3 (clause 1Thes.c4_11), the verb ἐστιν, “it is,” represents a relational process. What is related are “God’s will” and the demonstrative pronoun “this” (the content of “this” is spelled out in subsequent clauses, but it is basically the Thessalonians’ holiness).\n\nIn 4.12 (clause 1Thes.c4_42), the verb περιπατῆτε, “you may walk” (conduct yourselves) is a behavioral process, being an outward expression of inner workings of mindsets, desires, intentions, etc. leading to conduct).\n\nIn 4.15 (clause 1Thes.c4_56), the verb λέγομεν, “we say,” depicts a verbal process. What is said is “this” (the content of “this” is spelled out in subsequent clauses, basically the fact that those who are alive and remain at Christ’s appearing will not have an advantage over those who have died is recognized, constructed in Paul’s consciousness, and expressed verbally).\n\nIn 3.4 (clause 1Thes.c3_14), the verb ἐγένετο, “it happened,” pictures an existential process, recognizing that something happened. (In this case, the prediction about coming tribulation.)\n\nThe meanings expressed in every clause concerning the participants, processes, and circumstances and how they are related to each other (e.g., who is doing what to or for whom) are thus conveniently summarized in this annotation scheme. This scheme also provides a systematic basis for the analysis of the various elements of clause structure (e.g., the order of clause constituents and the company that different participants, processes, or circumstances keep). In addition, when applied to a text, the process types—material, mental, relational, behavioral, verbal, and existential—provide a broad functional summary of the text."

    "title": "Using Codex Sinaiticus as an Alternative to a Modern Eclectic Text",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Codex Sinaiticus was discovered in the nineteenth century by Constantine Tischendorf at St Catherine’s Monastery in the Sinai. He realized from the outset that this manuscript was one of the most important New Testament manuscripts ever discovered. His judgment at that time has proven correct. Despite the controversy that has surrounded this manuscript ever since, one fact is clear-it constitutes one of the two earliest major majuscule codex manuscripts used in textual criticism of the New Testament. In fact, Sinaiticus is the only one of these two codexes, the other being Codex Vaticanus, to be complete for the New Testament. The fourth-century date assigned to Sinaiticus and Vaticanus has suggested to many that these may have been two of the codex manuscripts reportedly prepared by Eusebeius for Constantine.\nIn any case, the general quality of the manuscripts, their completeness and their early date have given them a position of priority in text-critical circles from the time of Westcott and Hort to the present. Westcott and Hort labelled them the Neutral Text, and whereas few textual critics would use such language today, these two manuscripts still maintain a position of supreme importance. Examination of subsequent editions that put emphasis upon the Alexandrian textual tradition, such as the Nestle-Aland or UBSGNT text, shows that Sinaiticus and Vaticanus still reign supreme. Despite much discussion of the New Testament Greek papyri, many of them fairly recently discovered and published, their importance for New Testament textual criticism has not eclipsed the significance of the two major codexes. In fact, the departures by modern so-called eclectic Greek texts from these major codexes are often few in number in a given New Testament book, sometimes confined for the most part to variations in spelling.\nIn the light of this, it is worth considering whether there should not be a return to use of such a text as Codex Sinaiticus. Rather than being a scholarly construct of the twentieth century, Codex Sinaiticus, along with other ancient manuscripts, constituted an ancient manuscript actually used and revised by various early Christian communities (the various correcting hands of Sinaiticus attest to its use, but also raise a number of important critical issues). Therefore, it provides unparalleled access to an earlier form of the text as used by early Christians. The text of Sinaiticus constitutes the basis for the texts used in OpenText.org."

    "title": "Why OpenText.org?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "First-time visitors to this website may be wondering: What is the nature and purpose of this website? Why does OpenText.org exist? There are really several levels of motivations & several different kinds of issues our project is trying to address. One way of to answer this question is to summarize the purposes of the OpenText.org project under 4 headings:\n\nto address limitations of existing morphological texts\nto address limitations of traditional grammar\nto address limitations of traditional methods of studying texts, grammar, and lexis\nto provide material necessary for thorough discourse analysis & exegetical study\n\nFirst, we are trying to address the limitations of existing morphological texts. We realize that there are already some very fine texts in available software programs. Nevertheless, they are all strictly word-based, that is the information available is restricted to the morphology and meaning of individual words. Thus they are of limited help when our interest is in the patterns and meanings of constructions above the word-level such as phrases, clauses, and paragraphs. Currently, the word group and clause level annotations of OpenText.org provide previously-unavailable information on phrase and clause level patterns and meanings.\nSecond, we are trying to address the limitations of traditional grammar. We have a proud tradition of grammars and we literally stand on the shoulder of giants when we conduct studies on Greek grammar. We are by no means suggesting that we should start from scratch. Nevertheless, the major reference grammars are significantly dated and do not take into account the more complete textual evidence we now possess or insights from at least half a century of linguistic studies. By applying corpus linguistics, OpenText.org incorporates insights from modern linguistics and uses the considerable power of modern computers to provide comprehensive searches and displays of all available information on word, word group, and clause level grammatical and semantic phenomena. For those interested in learning Greek or in teaching Greek in a more effective manner, our levels of annotation also contain a basic framework for understanding Greek grammar that we believe is both easier to learn and sounder linguistically than what is often found in pedagogical grammars currently available (e.g., there is a confused mixing of formal and semantic labels and an unjustifiable multiplying of such labels for grammatical constructions like dozens of categories for the genitive construction).\nThird, we are trying to address the limitations of traditional methods of studying texts, grammar, and lexis. The word, word group, and clause information furnished by OpenText.org is designed to aid those studying texts, grammar, and/or lexis get comprehensive and reliable results in a time-efficient manner (e.g., getting complete evidence in seconds or minutes that may have taken weeks or months previously by manual counting). Besides help in overcoming previous limitations on comprehensiveness and time, the model and information supplied by our project is put forward as a starting point for further studies and discussions on what are effective methods of studying texts, grammar, and lexis. From our perspective, an effective method must be based on sound linguistic principles and we are unapologetic in commending the linguistic model upon which our project is built.\nFourth, we are trying to provide material necessary for thorough discourse analysis and exegetical study. As modern linguistic theory and studies have shown, studies focused mainly on words are inadequate and unable to provide thorough insight into the patterns and meanings of an entire discourse/text or even any given stretch of text. In New Testament studies, there is apparently increasing interest in analyzing entire discourses and in various methods of discourse analysis. With the OpenText.org project, we provide both a theory and a means of application of discourse analysis in our searchable and reusable texts. It is our hope that our work will not only aid many in doing thorough discourse analyses and exegetical studies, but also spur further discussion on and research into how to do discourse analysis and exegetical study in sounder and more effective ways."

    "text": "Imagine that you’re teaching an introductory class on the Gospels to university students. You have six weeks to instruct them how to read the Gospels, on top of educating them about the content of these writings, introductory issues, and other matters. Most of your students know practically nothing about the Gospels and don’t have the slightest idea how to read them. What kind of approach would you take to instruct them?\nI faced this situation when I taught my first class on the Synoptic Gospels. Having just applied M. A. K. Halliday’s model of systematic functional linguistics (SFL) to my study of “law” in Paul’s epistle to the Romans in my dissertation, I decided to take up the challenge of teaching uninitiated students how to apply aspects of this model to the study of the Gospels.\nThe first challenge was to boil down the theory into a simplified framework that my students could readily understand and learn. I explained that there are 3 components common to all linguistic representation:\n\nThe participants (the who & whom)\nThe process (what is happening or done)\nThe circumstances (when, where, how, why)\n\nUsing this system of “transitivity,” we represent through language who is doing what to/for whom under what kind of circumstances. The meanings represented can in turn be categorized under three main functions, answering the following three questions:\n\nWhat? (i.e., what is happening?)\nWho? (i.e., what roles are the participants playing?)\nHow? (i.e., how does what is happening and what roles the participants are playing fit together and cohere as a message?)\n\nSome students were able to apply the framework to read the Gospel texts without further assistance. The majority, however, remained unsure how to put the framework to use. My second challenge, then, was to present my students with a model to systematically ask and answer the questions concerning the participants, process, and circumstances and how everything coheres as a message. I prepared the following template to help them. First, I told them to use existing paragraph divisions and titles in their English Bibles as a starting point. Then, I taught them to ask the following two-part questions in sequence:\n\nWho are the main participants in the paragraph?; and how do you determine that those participants are the main ones?\nWhat are the role relationships between those participants? and how do you determine the role relationships between those participants?\nWhat are the main processes?; and how do you determine that those processes are the main ones?\n\nFinally, I instructed them to ask if there are any other words or ideas that are emphasized before painting an overall portrait of the passage with the answers they have given above. The first two-part question gets the students to trace the interaction of both the external participants (i.e., writer and audience) and internal participants (i.e., characters in the narrative or exposition). Participants that get the most press usually correspond to the main participants. The second two-part question leads the students to look further at descriptions of those participants and who is doing what to/for whom. The third two-part question focuses on what is happening. The main processes are usually repeated—either with the same or related words. While prominent participants and processes are picked up in the previous questions, possibly emphasized circumstances are taken into consideration in the final question before painting an overall portrait.\nWhat were the results of this experiment with teaching how to read a text using a simplified systemic functional framework? In an anonymous survey I conducted 4 weeks into the class, 11 out of 22 students rated the model as excellent and 3 others rated it as good. In the final two weeks of the class, I devoted much effort to clearing up the remaining confusion that some students had and gave the class more practice applying the model. In the section on text analysis on the final exam, 13 out of 22 students achieved 90% or above accuracy in answering questions on the various Gospel passages on which they were tested. Another 6 students scored 80% or above.\nWhat lessons may we learn from my teaching experience above? First, the basic concepts underlying systemic functional linguistics can, in fact, be readily understood and learned. Second, the SFL framework can help any would-be interpreter in the task of reading and understanding a biblical text like a Gospel passage.\nEven though the annotation model that you will be introduced to on this website is more sophisticated and technically rigorous, the basic concepts and questions remain the same as what I taught my students. The different levels of annotation play a role in answering each of these questions. For example, the clause level annotation elegantly captures who does what to/for whom under what circumstances in terms of the labels Subject (S), Predicator (P), Complement (C), and Adjunct (A). The participant referent annotation traces the interaction of the external and internal participants. The semantic domain annotation allows for the analysis of patterns of meaning repetition and thus discernment of prominent fields of meaning (i.e., what processes or circumstances are emphasized)."

    "title": "Introducing the OpenText.org Syntactically Analyzed Greek New Testament",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Summary\nThe OpenText.org project has recently completed what we believe to be the first syntactically annotated electronic Greek New Testament. We plan to make the results of this work available over the coming months on this site by allowing users to view, comment on and eventually search the texts of the New Testament. The purpose of this article is to provide a basic overview of what structures and features have been marked in the OpenText.org syntactical GNT and indicate some of the search and display facilities that it will make possible.\n\n\nWhat is syntax and what should a syntactical text include?\nMorphologically and lexically analyzed texts of the Greek New Testament have been available for a number of decades through the pioneering work of projects such as CCAT and the Gramcord project. These texts have been incorporated into most of the Bible software packages which provide powerful searching and display functionality. There are a range of schemes used in these various texts and a variety of different formal and semantic features are marked. However, the common denominator is the basic unit of analysis to which these features are attached–the word. There are limits to what grammatical information can and should be marked on a what. That is to say words alone make up only a part of the grammatical picture.\nGrammar is often defined of consisting of two complementary components:\n\nMorphology - the building blocks (i.e. stems, endings, prefixes, etc.) that come together to make up words\nSyntax - the structures and patterns by which words combine together and relate to one another to communicate meaning\n\nThese two components work together to make up the grammar of a language. There is variation from language to language as to the relative roles played by morphology and syntax. For instance, English morphology is somewhat weak or sparse in comparison to that of Hellenistic Greek, so syntax plays a more important role in establish grammatical functions in a clause such as subject and object. However, the difference between morphology, focused on the structure or pattern of the word, and syntax, focused on the patterns and structures that exist between words holds for all languages.\nThe large number of syntactical models have been developed in both traditional grammar and modern linguistics. And there are considerable differences in terminology, methods of analysis and focus. As far as possible a syntactically annotated text should try to utilize as broadly theory neutral a method of analysis as possible.\nThe question is what is a suitable model for the syntactical analysis of the Greek of the New Testament? This is best answered by listing some of the desirable features for such a model:\n\nThe model should be descriptive, that is, it should be able to account for the range of structures and patterns found in the New Testament corpus without assuming certain normal or idealized patterns.\nThe model should account for the various levels of grammar (or discourse), ranging from the word, phrase, clause, complex clause up through the paragraph and beyond. And as far as possible the analysis at each of these levels should remain distinct.\nThe model should make use of the smallest number of categories necessary to account for the fundamental or core components that make up the syntactical structures described.\nThese categories should be based primarily on formal distinctions, relying on interpretive or semantic distinctions as little as possible.\nThe model should be flexible and extensible so that future analysis, which may make use of a range of specific and more detailed models, can build on the basic units and structures marked in the text.\n\nWe have tried to build these qualities into the simple model used for the OpenText.org syntactical analysis. We have tried to keep the technical vocabulary to a minimum and focus on a small number basic features in a syntactical analysis.\n\nMarking the boundaries of the next two units of language above the word: the word group and the clause.\nMarking the extent, and labeling the function of the core components (or elements) within a clause (these include the subject, predicator (verb) and various adjuncts).\nAnalyzing the relations that exist between the words within a word group (or phrase). In other words, marking which words are modified by other words and what kind of modification holds between these words.\nMarking the basic relation of coordination or dependency (subordination) between clauses in a discourse.\n\nThe following sections cover each of these four stages and provide some examples.\n\n\n1. Units of analysis\nThe OpenText.org annotation model is organized according to levels of discourse, beginning with the word, moving up to the word group (made of one or more words), on to the clause (consisting of one or more word groups) and so on. The first release of the OpenText.org linguistically analyzed Greek New Testament covers levels 1 through 3 at what is termed the basic level of conformance. The table below lists the first three levels and the features that have been analyzed and marked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nUnit\nFeatures analyzed\n\n\n\n\n1\nWord\nlexical form, part-of-speech, morphological features relevant for each pos (i.e. tense-form, voice, mood for verbs and gender, case and number for nouns and adjectives) and semantic domain classification(s) for each word\n\n\n2\nWord group\nboundaries of the word group (i.e. which words it contains), head-term and its modifiers, connective words (i.e. conjunctions functioning within or between word groups)\n\n\n3\nClause\nboundaries of the clause, core components (Subject, Predicator, Complement and Adjunct) and peripheral components (conjunction, addressee) within the clause; clause level (Primary, Secondary or Embedded)\n\n\n\nApart from the additions of semantic domain information from the Louw-Nida Semantic Domain Lexicon, the features marked at Level 1: Word should be familiar from the existing morphological texts. Sections 2 and 3 below will explain the features marked at the word group and clause levels. Here we will just consider the concepts of the clause and word group.\n\nThe Clause Unit\nSomewhat formally, the clause can be defined as follows:\n\nA clause is a unit of language that contains a single proposition about which the language user is making an assertion, negation, query or suggestion\n\nLess formally, we could say that a clause will usually have just one finite verb-form or at least the implication of one (for ‘verbless’ clauses). Alternatively–using the linguistic terminology of a process to refer to an action or event involving one or more participants in a certain circumstance (or circumstances)–a clause contains a single main process and accompanying participants and circumstances.\nTo make the concept more concrete, consider the following example:\n\nJn 1.1: ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, καὶ ὁ λόγος ἦν πρὸς τὸν θεόν, καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος.\n\nAccording to the punctuation of the standard Greek text, this verse is a single sentence. The sentence has functioned as the core unit in both traditional grammar and much of syntactical theory in linguistics. However, the status or even existence of the sentence in Greek is highly debated. Leaving this question aside, it should be clear from the definitions of a clause that Jn 1.1 is neither a single proposition nor does it consist of just one finite verb-form (i.e. a single process).\nIt does in fact consist of three clauses:\n\nἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος | καὶ ὁ λόγος ἦν πρὸς τὸν θεόν | καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος |\n\n(Note that conjunctions are included within the boundaries of a clause and do not sit in between clauses as in some models).\nAt this most basic level, the OpenText.org text represents a significant advance over what has existed before. That is to say every single clause in the Greek New Testament has been explicitly marked. Searches for words and morphological features can now be reliably specified to search within a single clause.\n\n\nThe Word Group Unit\nTo define the word group we make use of the concept of a head-term–informally, a word that does not depend/modify any other word in its group.\nA word group consists of a single head-term and any and all of its modifiers, though it will frequently consist of just a single word.\nFor example, in the first clause of Jn 1.1 there are three word groups (head terms are underlined and word group boundaries marked with brackets):\n\n[ ἐν ἀρχῇ ] [ ἦν ] [ ὁ λόγος ]\n\nFrequently the boundaries of a single word group will coincide with the boundaries of the functional components within a clause (discussed below), such as subject, predicator (verb) and complement (e.g. direct or indirect object). However, often there will be a series of word groups within a single component. For example, consider the subject of the first clause in 1 Thessalonians chapter 1 (marked in bold):\n\n1 Thess. 1.1: Παῦλος καὶ Σιλουανὸς καὶ Τιμόθεος τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ Θεσσαλονικέων ἐν θεῷ πατρὶ καὶ κυρίῳ Ἰησοῦ Χριστῷ\n\nThe ‘subject’ of the clause, ‘Paul and Timothy and Silas’, consists of three word groups:\n\n[ Παῦλος ] [ καὶ Σιλουανὸς ] [ καὶ Τιμόθεος ] [ τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ Θεσσαλονικέων ] [ ἐν θεῷ πατρὶ ] [ καὶ κυρίῳ Ἰησοῦ Χριστῷ ]\n\nAgain, at a basic level marking the boundaries of every single word group in the New Testament–as we have done in the OpenText.org syntactical text–is a significant advance over existing morphologically analyzed texts. It is thereby possible to search for combinations of words within the boundaries of a word group. For example, one might want to search for all occurrences of the words θεός and ἀγάπη in a single word group, i.e. one of the words is modified by another. With existing texts and search programs, you would have specify a certain number of words for the extent of the search and the search might return instances where the two words are actually in consecutive word groups.\nCombining the analysis of word group and clause boundaries, Jn 1.1 can be represented as follows:\n\n[ ἐν ἀρχῇ ] [ ἦν ] [ ὁ λόγος ] |\n[ καὶ ] [ ὁ λόγος ] [ ἦν ] [ πρὸς τὸν θεόν ] |\n[ καὶ ] [ θεὸς ] [ ἦν ] [ ὁ λόγος ] |\n\n\n\n\n2. Clause structure\nIn the previous section the existence of grammatical functions within a clause, such as subject and object, was alluded to. In addition to marking clause boundaries a syntactical model should account for these kinds of components within the clause. Various categories and methods of analysis exist within different syntactical models. Tree structures are often used as a means of displaying the structure of a clause with formal labels on the various nodes such as NP (noun phrase), VP (verb phrase) and PP (prepositional phrase). For example, the English sentence, The dog chases the squirrel in the park, would be represented as:\n\nThis kind of analysis (along with a set of rules to specify allowable structures and operations to form particular configurations) has proved particularly valuable for languages such as English where syntax plays a key role in determining grammatical function. It is also central within formal models that focus primarily on the specification of the internal language faculty and less on the description of actual instances of language use. It does, however, have limitations for working with a ‘dead’ (epigraphic) language like Hellenistic Greek and with languages with a relatively free word order. For instance, it is questionable whether a verb phrase unit operates in Greek. Further, the phrases in this analysis are identified according to the part-of-speech category of their dominant term, i.e. NP = noun, VP = verb, PP = preposition. These labels give little information as to how the particular phrase is functioning within the sentence.\nRecent developments in syntactical theory have focused on grammatical functions (subject, object, etc.) and associated semantic roles (agent, actor, patient, goal, etc.). This has added considerable descriptive power to the models, particularly as analysis moves to the larger units of discourse (i.e. in discourse analysis). The OpenText.org analysis of the clause recognizes and marks a small set of grammatical functions within a clause. These functions are associated with divisions/components within the clause. These can be thought of as different slots filled by certain word groups. Even though the terms used to describe these slots may be unfamiliar to users of the OpenText.org database, one should be able to understand the boundaries of these components.\n\nThe ‘Core’ Clause Components\nThe clause components can be divided into core and peripheral components, depending on their involvement with the process of the clause. The core components are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nAbbreviation\nContains\n\n\n\n\nSubject\nS\ngrammatical subject\n\n\nPredicator\nP\nmain verb\n\n\nComplement\nC\nobjects and other words that ‘complete’ the verb\n\n\nAdjunct\nA\nadverbs, adverbial clauses, prepositional phrases modifying the verb\n\n\n\nThese can be illustrated with the analysis of 3 John 1. This particular diagrammatical representation uses boxes to represent clauses, with the components as divisions within each box. (For now we can ignore the difference between gray and pink clauses).\n\n\n\nClause diagram for 3 John 1\n\n\nThe first clause does not contain a verb, so has no Predicator. But the two participants in the implied ‘greeting’ process are represented with Subject (‘the elder’) and the Complement (‘beloved Gaius’) ‘slots’. The second clause contains one of each of the four core components.\nMore formal definitions of these components are:\n\nThe Predicator (P) of a clause is its verbal element, which grammaticalizes the process of the clause.\nThe Subject (S) of a clause is the word group or word groups providing greater specification regarding the grammatical subject of a finite verb form (the morphological indication of person and number). For finite verbs the head term of this group (or these groups) are in the nominative case. In infinitive clauses the ‘subject’ may be indicated in the accusative case. In so-called ‘genitive absolute’ constructions the subject component occurs in the genitive case. A clause will often have no subject component and can have at most one subject component.\nA Complement (C) of a clause is a word group or the word groups that ‘completes’ the predicate of the clause. The categories of direct and indirect object from traditional grammar are among those classified as complements. A clause may have no complement or many complements. With relation to the process of the clause, the complement(s) are those components of the clause that answer the question “who?” or “what?” is affected by the process.\nAn Adjunct (A) of a clause is a word group or the word groups that modify the predicate, providing an indication of the circumstances associated with the process. Common adjuncts are prepositional and adverbial phrases (adverbs) and also embedded “adverbial clauses”. With relation to the process of the clause, adjuncts provide answers to questions of the type “where?”, “when?”, “why?” and “how?”.\n\n\n\nThe ‘Peripheral’ Clause Components\nThere are two further clause components that are described as peripheral because they are not as closely connected to the process as the core components. The conjunction component contains words that function to link the clause to preceding or following clauses in the discourse. The addressee component serves an interpersonal function and contains words used to call attention to one of the participants (either internal or external) in the discourse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nAbbreviation\nContains\n\n\n\n\naddressee\nadd\nvocative forms or forms functional interpersonally to call attention, i.e. nominative as a vocative\n\n\nconjunction\ncj\nconjunctions and other participles used to link clauses\n\n\n\nThese components, along with the core components, are illustrated in the box clause diagram for 3 John 2:\n\n\n\nClause diagram for 3 John 2\n\n\nThe first clause begins with the vocative, ἀγαπητέ, creating an external link or call to the hearer/addressee of the letter. The process of this clause, εὔχομαί (pray), is not accompanied by an explicit subject but has temporal/sequential circumstance, περὶ πάντων (‘before all things’), as an adjunct and a complex complement containing two infinitive clauses. The complement illustrates a frequent phenomenon where a clause occurs as the content of a clause component. This is referred to as ‘clause embedding’. Embedded clauses frequently have non-finite verbs as predicators, i.e. participial and infinitive clauses. However, finite clauses can also be embedded within a component of another clauses, i.e. a relative clause as the subject of a clause. In terms of structural analysis, embedded clauses are treated in the same way as unembedded clauses. The embedded clause 3Joh.c1_5 begins with a cj (conjunction) slot. This word functions to link clause 3Joh.c1_5 to 3Joh.c1_4. In the same way, 3Joh.c1_6 begins with καθὼς, a conjunction component that links the clause to 3Joh.c1_3.\nThe addition of clause components within the clause boundaries opens up a whole range of search potential. It is possible to search for clauses containing specific components, i.e. clauses with PC or SPC components, which are likely to be transitive clauses. One could also examine the ordering of components, i.e. SPC versus PSC and so on. Combining features annotated in Levels 1 and 2 it is possible to search for particular combinations of lexical forms, grammatical features and semantic domains occurring within particular clause components. For example, a search might specify clauses that have the word θεός in the Subject slot and a Predicator containing an active verb form from semantic domain 57 (Possess, Transfer, Exchange) of the Louw-Nida lexicon. This would find clauses such as those in Rom. 1.24 & 26:\n\n\n\nClause diagram for Romans 1.24 Clause diagram for Romans 1.26\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Word group relations\nMarking the boundaries of word groups within a clause was discussed in section 1 above. A word group consists of a single head term and the words which modify the head term. These modifiers can in turn be modified by other words, which can be further modified by additional words, and so on. Syntactical theories refer to this kind of chain of modification (that theoretically can be endless) as recursion.\nAn illustration of how the analysis of word group modification can be seen in the word group ἐν τῷ θελήματι τοῦ θεοῦ (‘in/by the will of God’) from Rom. 1.10. The head term is θελήματι, which is modified directly by three words: ἐν, τῷ and θεοῦ. The last of these modifiers,θεοῦ, is in turn modified by τοῦ. This analysis is illustrated in the dependency tree diagram:\n\n\nThe basic elements included in the word group analysis–the marking of the boundaries of the group (i.e. the division of the Greek New Testament into phrase units) and the marking of the modification relations that exist between words within a group–represent a significant advance over what is currently available in morphological texts. It is now possible, for instance, to search for a certain word, e.g. ‘will’ and produce a list of the words that modify it in the New Testament.\n\nThe next step is to add type values on top of the modification links between words. In other words, to specify what kind of modification relation holds between the two words. Unsurprisingly, there are a number of different models of how these relationships between words and their modifiers should be described and a range of associated terminology. In the OpenText.org model we have tried to identify a small number of modification types that take place between individual words:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModification type\nAbbreviation\nTypical word type\n\n\n\n\nSpecifier\nsp\narticle, preposition\n\n\nDefiner\ndf\nadjectives, appositional words, adjectival clauses\n\n\nQualifier\nql\ngenitives, datives, negative particles negating word or word group\n\n\nRelator\nrl\nwords modified by a preposition, i.e. in traditional terms the head term of the object of a preposition\n\n\n\nThe word group analysis can be visualized using a series of nested boxes. Each box represents a word, the form of which is placed in the top row.\n\nUnder the word are four slots, one for each of the possible modification relations. Other words–boxes with the same structure–can put placed into these slots and so on.\n\nThe word group ἐν τῷ θελήματι τοῦ θεοῦ would be represented as follows. It should be clear how quite complex structures and levels of nesting can result. But the basic principle that every word is either a head term or a modifier of one other word is always in operation.\nThe following are more formal definitions of each of the four modification types marked in the OpenText.org word group annotation.\n\nSpecifiers (sp)\n\nA Specifier is a modifier that classifies or identifies the word it modifies.\n\nCommon examples of specifiers are articles, e.g. ἡ ἀδελφή, and prepositions, e.g. ἐν δόξῃ. In a preposition phrase such as εἰς τὸν λόγον, both εἰς and τὸν are specifiers of λόγον\n\n\nDefiners (df)\n\nA Definer is a modifier that attributes features or further defines the word it modifies.\n\nCommon examples of definers are adjectives (both attributive and predicate structure) and appositional words or phrases.\n\n\nQualifiers (ql)\n\nA Qualifier is a modifier that in some way limits or constrains the scope of the word it modifies.\n\nCommon examples of qualifiers are words in the genitive and dative case, and also negative particles functioning at the word group level.\n\n\nRelators (rl)\n\nA Relator is a modifier which is specified by a preposition (i.e. the Relator is the object of a preposition) that modifies another element within the word group.\n\nFor example, in the word group κατ᾽ ἐμὲ πρόθυμον, the term ἐμὲ is in a prepositional relationship with the head term πρόθυμον. This relationship only applies to prepositional phrases within word groups and not when the prepositional phrase functions as a clause component.\nHaving the four modification types: specifier, definer, qualifier and relator, marked in an electronic Greek New Testament opens up a whole range of search possibilities. Because of the relative flexibility of Greek word order it is not always easy to find all the modifiers of a word with a single search rule. For example, consider the placement of the possessive pronoun σου in a few word groups from Philemon.\n\nPhlm 2. τῇ κατ᾽ οἶκόν σου ἐκκλησίᾳ\nPhlm 5. σου τὴν ἀγάπην\nPhlm 7. ἐπὶ τῇ ἀγάπῃ σου\n\nThe genitive modifier σου can either follow or precede the word it modifies. The fact could be included in a search using a standard morphological text. However, this may lead to imprecise or ambiguous results. For instance, it seems clear that σου qualifies οἶκόν and not ἐκκλησίᾳ in Phlm 2. But allowing for modifiers to precede and follow the word they modify in a search wouldn’t exclude either possibility. The annotation of word group structure and modification relations allows for more accurate searches to be carried out.\n\n\n\n4. Clause connections and levels\nA strict adherence to the levels of analysis principle would mean that any information above the level of the clause concerning the way in which clauses relate to one another should belong to the next level (Level 4 - Paragraph) above the clause. However, to make the first release of the OpenText.org annotation useful for the study of stretches of text larger than the clause we have included some basic connection and dependency information at the clause level.\n\nClause Levels\nThere are three basic types of clause recognized in the OpenText.org analysis, related to the informational level on which they function. As a discourse is created, information is presented in a sequential or linear order (i.e. it is not possible to say everything at the same time, so information must be ordered).\nCertain clauses belong to primary level of information, that is they introduce new pieces of information and move the message of the discourse along from the start towards the end of the message. Some models of discourse refer to this level as the backbone of discourse. In spatial terms, primary clauses can be said to function to provide the horizontal movement within the discourse.\n\nOther clauses, referred to as secondary clauses serve to provide further definition or to add to the information presented in a primary clause. In spatial terms they build up in the vertical plane. The functional, discourse explanation of primary and secondary clauses can be supplemented with the following table, which lists the three types of clause and the formal or categorical features that determine them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClause type/level\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nPRIMARY\nAn independent clause (usually contains a finite verb form) that is not dependent on or subordinate to any other clause.\n\n\nSECONDARY\nA clause that depends on (is subordinate to) another clause. This dependency/subordination is usually indicated by the presence of certain particles/conjunctions (traditionally referred to as subordinating particles). Common secondary clauses are relative clauses and clauses beginning with words such as ὡς/καθώς and ὅτε/ὅταν. Non-embedded participle and infinitive clauses (i.e. genitive absolute and infinitive clauses beginning with a preposition + article combination) as also classified as secondary.\n\n\nEMBEDDED\nA clause that occurs inside a component of another clause. Frequently the predicator of embedded clauses are non-finite (i.e. participal and infinitive clauses), but finite clauses can also be embedded.\n\n\n\nIn the box clause diagrams in the sample section of the OpenText.org website, primary clauses are pink and secondary and embedded clauses are gray.\n\n\nClause connections\nAlongside the three levels of clause distinguished in the OpenText.org clause annotation is the concept of clause connection. Each clause is marked with a connect value which indicates the clause within the surrounding discourse to which it is most immediately relates. In the diagram below, this value is indicated at the beginning of each clause underneath the clause identifier.\n\nSo clause Rom.c1_26 connects to Rom.c1_24. Rom.c1_26 is a secondary clause connected to a primary clause, so it is indented and said to depend on Rom.c1_24. The next non-embedded clause, Rom.c1_28 is also a secondary clause and it connects back to Rom.c1_26. However, it has been analyzed in a coordinate relationship (connected by καὶ) and so is not indented. In contrast, the following clause, Rom.c1_29, is subordinate to the clause it connects with (Rom.c1_26) and is therefore displayed with a further level of indentation.\nFuture work will be focused on refining these categories and considering if there are appropriate categories, such as purpose, cause, condition, etc., that could be applied to the connections and dependencies between clauses.\n\n\n\nSummary\nThe purpose of this article has been to introduce the work of the OpenText.org in completing the initial syntactical analysis and annotation of the Greek New Testament. The following features of the OpenText.org syntactically analyzed Greek New Testament text have been highlighted:\n\nThe marking of units above the word level, namely the word group and the clause.\nThe analysis of every clause using simple functional categories: Subject, Predicator, Complement and Adjunct.\nThe determination of the relationships of modification that hold between the words in a word group and assigning them to one of four basic semantic types: Specifier, Definer, Qualifier and Relator.\nThe clause types/levels, Primary, Secondary and Embedded and the ways in which they interact."

    "text": "What is the rationale for undertaking Opentext.org as a project? In a nutshell, Opentext.org is a web-based initiative to provide an annotated corpus of Greek texts and tools for their analysis. The long term goal of the project is to construct a representative corpus of Hellenistic Greek (including the entire New Testament and selected Hellenistic writings of the same period) to facilitate linguistic and literary research of the New Testament documents. For most of our users, this succinct answer may need further expansion and clarification. We may do this by answering the following two questions.\n\nWhat Is a Corpus?\nFirst, “What is a corpus and is there a distinction between a text and a corpus?” A text is basically a written discourse that is considered a unit. For instance, the epistle to the Romans is a text, and so are the Gospel of John and the third epistle of John. A corpus, however, is not simply a collection of texts. A corpus “seeks to represent a language or some part of a language.” Thus, a corpus consists of an intentional grouping of particular texts, according to specific criteria. For example, one could collect a corpus of the sayings of Jesus or of the letters attributed to Peter. There is no reason why all the New Testament texts or any combination of the New Testament texts cannot be considered a corpus. As used here, a corpus is “a finite-sized body of machine-readable text, sampled in order to be maximally representative of the language variety under consideration.” To make it machine-readable, the Greek text of the New Testament is encoded in Extensible Markup Language (XML), which is designed to clearly label data and enable its users to access, manipulate, and repackage that data with ease.\n\n\nWhat Are the Characteristics of Corpus-Based Analysis?\nThe essential characteristics of corpus-based analysis are as follows:\n\nit is empirical, analyzing the actual patterns of use in natural texts;\nit utilizes a large and principled collection of natural texts, known as a “corpus,” as the basis for analysis;\nit makes extensive use of computers for analysis, using both automatic and interactive techniques;\nit depends on both quantitative and qualitative analytical techniques.\n\nThese characteristics lead to at least four advantages in using a corpus-based approach in studies of language use. First, computers can handle large amounts of language and keep track of many contextual factors simultaneously. Second, actual language usage in the corpus (not just a theoretical construct) is the object of analysis. Third, computer-assisted analysis facilitates the accounting of the extent to which a pattern is found and of contextual factors that influence variability. Fourth, by means of the data-handling capability of computers many previously unfeasible research questions can be asked.",
